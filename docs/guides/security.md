# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the GRC Assessment Application.

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Container Security
- **Non-root user execution**: Containers run as user `grc` (UID 1001) instead of root
- **Minimal base image**: Uses Alpine Linux for reduced attack surface
- **Health checks**: Implemented container health monitoring

### 2. File Upload Security

#### Antivirus Scanning
- **Real-time scanning**: All uploaded files are scanned before storage
- **Threat detection**: Implements signature-based and heuristic detection
- **Quarantine system**: Malicious files are automatically quarantined
- **Audit logging**: All scan results are logged for compliance

#### Controlled Storage
- **Encryption at rest**: Files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **Tenant isolation**: Files are stored in tenant-specific directories
- **Signed URLs**: Secure file access through time-limited signed URLs
- **Access logging**: All file access attempts are logged

#### File Validation
- **MIME type checking**: Only allowed file types are accepted
- **Size limits**: Configurable file size restrictions
- **Filename validation**: Prevents directory traversal and malicious filenames
- **Content inspection**: Basic content-based threat detection

### 3. Network & Runtime Hardening

#### Rate Limiting
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication**: 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **File uploads**: 20 uploads per hour per IP

- **Session timeout**: 8-hour maximum session duration
- **Concurrent session limits**: Maximum 3 sessions per user
- **Session invalidation**: Proper cleanup on logout

#### JWT Security
- **Short-lived tokens**: 15-minute access token expiry
- **Refresh token rotation**: 7-day refresh token expiry
- **Secure algorithms**: HS256 with strong secrets
- **Token validation**: Comprehensive token verification

### 5. Database Security

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at rest**: Sensitive fields encrypted in database
- **Connection encryption**: SSL/TLS for database connections
- **Parameterized queries**: Prevents SQL injection
- **Connection pooling**: Secure connection management

#### Access Control
- **Tenant isolation**: Row-level security for multi-tenancy
- **Role-based access**: Granular permission system
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive activity logging

### 6. Monitoring & Auditing

#### Security Audit Log
- **Comprehensive logging**: All security events are logged
- **Risk assessment**: Events categorized by risk level
- **Threat indicators**: Suspicious activity tracking
- **Compliance reporting**: Audit trails for regulatory compliance

#### Security Dashboard
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live security status overview
- **Threat statistics**: AV scan results and threat detection
- **Storage metrics**: Secure storage utilization
- **Recent events**: Latest security events and alerts

## 🛠 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Copy `.env.security.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Essential security settings
STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-key

## 🆘 Incident Response

### Detection
- Automated threat detection
- Real-time monitoring alerts

## Canonical Domain & Login Flow

- Canonical domain: `https://www.shahin-ai.com`
- Frontend enforces canonical host in production; non-canonical hosts redirect to the canonical domain preserving path and query
- Landing page `/` hosts the login form; `/login` redirects to `/`
- Protected routes (`/app`, `/advanced`, tenant routes) require authentication and redirect unauthenticated users to `/`

## BFF URL and CSP

- Canonical BFF/backend URLs: `https://grc-backend.shahin-ai.com`, `https://bff-donganksa.vercel.app`
- CSP `connect-src` allows: `self`, localhost for development, `https://grc-backend.shahin-ai.com`, `wss://grc-backend.shahin-ai.com`, `https://www.shahin-ai.com`, `wss://www.shahin-ai.com`, and `https://bff-donganksa.vercel.app` including `wss`

## Backend Origin Enforcement

- Login endpoints accept requests only when `Origin` is `https://www.shahin-ai.com` in production; others receive `403`
